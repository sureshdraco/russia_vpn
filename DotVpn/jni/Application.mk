What is Sendly?
Sendly allows you to quickly and easily top up the prepaid mobile phones of friends and family abroad. Your loved ones can then make calls, send texts or use these credits as they choose.
Sendly is an app developed by Rebtel, one of the world's most popular international calling providers.

How to?
1) Select a contact - Sendly automatically shows the names of the people that can receive prepaid credit.
2) Choose the amount - Youâ€™ll see the amount you want to send to your friend.
3) Confirm your payment - Use any credit card. Most transfers only take a few seconds to go through.

Why can't I top up my friend's phone?
Sendly supports over 100 countries and operators worldwide and we keep adding to that list. If your friend does not have the top up icon to their number, it's because we don't support their country or operator yet.


Why did my top up fail?
- We do not support your friend's country or operator at this time.
- The phone number is incorrect. Please check the number and try again.
- Check your credit card information or contact your bank for more details.
